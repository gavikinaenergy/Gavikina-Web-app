						Gavikina Energy is the brand name for Gavikina Nigeria Limited. We
						serve homes, businesses and multi-site operations across Nigeria
						that are tired of budgeting for fuel. We are engineers first: every
						system is sized from a measured load, not a sales target, and every
						quote is confirmed on site before a panel is ordered.
					</p>
					<p>
						The work is deliberately narrow. We size, supply, install and
						commission complete systems — panels, inverter, batteries, mounting,
						protection and cabling — and we stay reachable afterwards. No cart,
						no bundles, no upsell on hardware you will not use.
					</p>
					<p>
						What you own at the end is an asset on your roof, not a
						subscription.
